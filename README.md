Q)An explanation of how you scraped the data
This data was scraped using Github API and requests library in Python, in this code i aslo made use of pagination and delays of 1 second between pages to ensure i dont hit the rate limit for free usage. I extracted the created dataframes as csv files which i then exported as excel files for further analysis using Microsoft Excel.

Q)The most interesting and surprising fact you found after analyzing the the data
The most interesting and surprising fact i found out is the popular languages (in terms of average rating) used for the repositories, my initial assumption was that languages like Python, C or HTML would be popular however it seems like Perl, HCL and Arduino are well-liked. Of course the most popular in terms of number of repositories does go to the more well-known programming languages like JavaScript, Python and HTML.
 
Q)An actionable recommendation for developers based on your analysis
My recommendation would be to consider different methods of analysis, not just one, especially if you are comfortable with just one language/software only. I used excel mainly for this exercise beacuse it was na opportunity to expmnad my skills beyond python.
